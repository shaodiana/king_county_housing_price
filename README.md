The purpose of this exercise is to understand how to use statsmodel.formula.api instead of statsmodel.api. The differences between the two include:
1. Whether a constant is included in a regression model by default
2. How to specify the regressions. The statsmodel.formula.api allows one to set up the regression more like in R, where one can indicate whether a variable is a categorical variable.
